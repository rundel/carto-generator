carto-generator
--------
This is a testbed for the implementation of a native C++ generator for the carto stylesheet language. Current example implementation handles parsing of mapnik XML style files. As this example uses mapnik's load_map functionality the XML file must correctly specify the location of any datasources or an error will result.

Requirements
------------
- Recent revision of Mapnik2 from SVN
- Boost 1.4.7 beta 1 or newer

Building
--------
To build the example application:

	make

The included makefile has been tested on OSX 10.6.7 with Mapnik2 and Boost installed via the [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) package management system. It has not been tested on Linux or Windows, please report any issues you encounter on these or other systems. Note that the makefile currently uses clang++ as the default compiler, this can be changed to g++ by commenting and uncommenting the relevant lines.

Running
-------
The example application can be run as follows:

	./example tests/test.xml
	./example tests/map.xml
